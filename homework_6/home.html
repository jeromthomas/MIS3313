            The painting appears, after cleaning, to be an autograph replica of
            a picture, the original of which was painted in Brussels in 1782 in
            free imitation of Ruben's 'Chapeau de Paille', which LeBrun had seen
            in Antwerp. It was exhibited in Paris in 1782 at the salon de la
            Correspondance. LeBrun's original is recorded in a private
            collection in France.
